Chain is fairly easy to use  and the UI is easy to get around.
What makes it hard to use is remembering all the steps. As the steps to each action has a clear structure.
Gary pointed out a clear problem that he and myself relied heavy on the slack group to communicate with each other.
We needed to send each other asset ID, account ID and more, this was excluding the Network access tokens, Generator URL and Blockchain ID 
that were needed to connect on the same Network.
I found that I had to constantly reference 
http://13.95.95.38:1999/docs/core/build-applications/transaction-basics#creating-transactions 
to know what action i had to do on certain transactions but it was really easy to do once we got into it.
